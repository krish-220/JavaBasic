		 /*
		  * constructor does not return any value
		  * static:
		  * It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
		  * 
		  * In static method we wont create object but we will create a object for non static method.
		  * 
		  * Can we overload java main() method?
			yes, we can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. 
			But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only.
			
			Can we override java main method?
			No, because the main is a static method
			
			Final Keyword:
			Its stop value change 
			stop method overriding(If you make any method as final, you cannot override it)
			stop inheritance
